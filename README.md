# DSND_Capstone_Sparkify

**Background** 

This project is part of the Udacity DSND program where we got exposure to the tools used to work with “Big Data”. This project was very interesting as it focused on something that business all around the globe evaluate and try to reduce as much as possible. I am of course talking about churn. Churn, or customer churn is also known as customer turnover or customer attrition; it is essentially the loss of a customer or client.
The data used in this project was the smaller subset of the original 12GB file which was approximately 128MB. The reason we are using the smaller dataset is so we can run this locally as the larger file would be far to large for most desktop computers to handle.

**Requirements** 
- Anaconda (Not required by recomended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3
- PySpark
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn 
- Pandas

**Instructions**
Dataset= 'Sparkify' Small Dataset https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-hi73PWXdMxNLvYWJtL2Y6Rig2rT5B5K

To Run Locally on Your Computer
1. Launch anaconda and open the notebook "Sparkify.ipynb"
2. Run the notebook -- you should get the same results as the models were set to have a random seed -- there could be variation because I did not set a seed when spilting the data into the test and training set. 

**Results**
- Accuracy:  0.85
- Precision:  0.71
- Recall:  0.62
- F1-Score:  0.67
