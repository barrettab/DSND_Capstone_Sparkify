# DSND_Capstone_Sparkify

**Background** 

This project is all about using Apache Spark and how you can use to to handle big data to create a model that will predict customer churn for a fictional music streaming company created by Udacity called "Sparkify". Churn is another way to saying a customer cancellation.  

The goal of this is in the real world would be to use this to 

**Requirements** 
- Anaconda (Not required by recomended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3
- PySpark
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn 
- Pandas

**Instructions**
Dataset= 'Sparkify' Small Dataset https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-hi73PWXdMxNLvYWJtL2Y6Rig2rT5B5K

To Run Locally on Your Computer
1. Launch anaconda and open the notebook "Sparkify.ipynb"
2. Run the notebook -- you should get the same results as the models were set to have a random seed -- there could be variation because I did not set a seed when spilting the data into the test and training set. 

**Results**
- Accuracy:  0.85
- Precision:  0.71
- Recall:  0.62
- F1-Score:  0.67
